Interceptor Pattern (Middleware):

The interceptor pattern, often referred to as
middleware in web development, is a design pattern
that allows you to insert processing logic at various
points request/response pipeline.
It's commonly used in web frameworks and other systems
to perform actions like authentication, logging, 
input validation, and more, before or after handling a request.

Key Concepts:
    Middleware Chain:
        Middleware components are organized into a chain or stack. Each middleware component processes a request, possibly modifies it, and passes it along to the next component in the chain.
    Order of Execution:
        Middleware components execute in a specific order, typically from top to bottom in the stack. This order is important as it determines the sequence in which processing occurs.
    Request and Response:
        Middleware components have access to both the incoming request and the outgoing response, allowing them to inspect, modify, or augment them.
